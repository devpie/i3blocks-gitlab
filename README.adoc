This is just a simple tool for displaying the merge request count and the approved merge request count of a group within i3blocks.

== Installation instructions
There are the following requirements:
* keyring - for loading the gitlab token out of your keyring

You also need i3blocks 1.4.

You need to specify a config file at ~/.i3blocks-gitlab
[source,ini]
----
[gitlab]
group_id = 44
group_name = mygroup
base_url = https://gitlab.com
user_id = 13
web_browser = chromium
label = GitLab:
approved_merge_requests_label = Approved Gitlab MRs:
all_merge_requests_label = All MRs:
----

And the i3blocks config file entry should look like this:
[source,bash]
----
[gitlab]
command=python <path_i3blocks_gitlab>/mr_state.py $BLOCK_BUTTON
interval=10
----

And you need to create a private token for accessing Gitlab.

Before starting mr_state.py for the first time please save this Gitlab token
in your keyring with:

[source,bash]
----
python -m keyring set gitlab only-secret
----
